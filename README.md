# Real estate vs Stocks
One of the most important financial decisions in your life is whether to buy or rent your housing, because the equity you invest in the home is money that you do not invest in other assets such as index funds for US or international equities. 
This repo provides a way to quantiatively compare the return on investment for real estate and index investing. The analysis is explained and visualized in the notebook RE_v_stocks.ipynb. The results of the notebook can be reproduced by using the csv files in the repo.
